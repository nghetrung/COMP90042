# Overview

In this homework, you'll be quantifying the similarity between pairs of words of a dataset using different methods with the word co-occurrence in the Brown corpus and synset structure of WordNet. Firstly, you will preprocess the dataset to filter out the rare and ambiguous words. Secondly, you will calculate the similarity scores for pairs of words in the filtered dataset using Lin similarity, NPMI and LSA. Lastly, you will quantify how well these methods work by comparing to a human annotated gold-standard.
